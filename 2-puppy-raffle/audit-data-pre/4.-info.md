### [I-1] Use of Floating Pragma Version in `PuppyRaffle.sol` May Lead to Compatibility Issues and Inconsistent Behavior


**Description:**  
The Solidity version `pragma solidity ^0.7.6;` in the `PuppyRaffle.sol` contract is a floating version specifier. This means the contract can be compiled with any version of Solidity that is compatible with `0.7.6`, including future minor and patch versions. While this may seem convenient, it poses significant risks because future Solidity versions could introduce breaking changes or optimizations that may not be compatible with the contract's code.

Using a floating version specifier, such as `^0.7.6`, can lead to inconsistencies, as new versions of the Solidity compiler might change certain behaviors, introduce unexpected bugs, or even compromise security. For example, newer compiler versions may implement optimizations or bug fixes that could unintentionally affect the contract's logic or gas consumption, causing it to behave unpredictably.


**Impact:**  
The main issue with using a floating pragma version is that it introduces a potential lack of control over which compiler version is used to compile the contract. This can lead to the following negative consequences:

1. **Inconsistent Behavior:** Changes in future versions of Solidity may alter how certain functions or features are handled. This could lead to the contract behaving differently, especially in edge cases, without any changes being made to the contract's source code.
   
2. **Security Risks:** Future versions of Solidity could include optimizations or changes to the compiler that may introduce vulnerabilities or unintended side effects in the contract, especially if the contract relies on specific behavior that has been altered.

3. **Maintenance Challenges:** By not locking the Solidity version, the contract may become difficult to maintain and test, as developers may not be able to guarantee the same behavior across different compiler versions. This could result in issues when updating the contract or attempting to integrate it with other contracts that rely on a fixed Solidity version.

4. **Potential Deployment Failures:** If a new version of Solidity is released that is incompatible with the contract, it may fail to compile or deploy correctly. This could cause significant delays in deployment or require extensive refactoring of the contract.


**Proof of Concept:**  
Here is the specific instance found in the `PuppyRaffle.sol` contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.7.6;
```

By using the floating version `^0.7.6`, the contract can be compiled with versions ranging from `0.7.6` to any future minor or patch version below `0.8.0`. While this might seem convenient, it introduces the risk of breaking changes with each new compiler release. For example, if a future version of Solidity introduces a bug or optimization that changes the way certain operations are performed, this could affect the contract without any indication in the source code.

**Recommended Mitigation:**

To avoid the risks associated with using a floating version specifier, it is recommended to use a specific version of Solidity. Here are some mitigation strategies:

1. **Use a Specific Solidity Version:**  
   Instead of using a floating version like `^0.7.6`, specify the exact version of Solidity that the contract should be compiled with. For example, use:
   ```solidity
   pragma solidity 0.7.6;
   ```
This ensures that the contract is only compiled with that specific version, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities introduced by future compiler releases.

2. **Regular Audits and Updates:**
Regularly audit the contract to ensure compatibility with the latest Solidity versions. If necessary, update the contract to be compatible with new versions, but always lock to the exact version to avoid unexpected changes.

3. **Testing and Compatibility Checks:**
Before deploying with a new version of Solidity, ensure thorough testing on testnets to confirm that the contract functions as expected with the updated compiler version.

### [I-2] Use of outdated Solidity version `^0.7.6` in `PuppyRaffle.sol` contract

**Description:**  
The `PuppyRaffle.sol` contract uses the floating version specifier `^0.7.6` for Solidity, which allows the contract to be compiled with versions from `0.7.6` up to, but not including, `0.8.0`. While this seems convenient, it introduces the risk of unexpected changes as new Solidity versions are released.

By using `^0.7.6`, the contract may compile successfully with newer Solidity versions that could include breaking changes or optimizations, potentially affecting the contract’s functionality or security. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, making the contract harder to audit and maintain.

**Impact:**  
Using an outdated version of Solidity, such as `^0.7.6`, poses several risks to the stability and security of the contract. With every new release, Solidity introduces important optimizations, new features, and critical bug fixes. By relying on an outdated compiler version, the contract is missing out on the benefits of these improvements, potentially compromising its performance and security.

Some of the key advantages of upgrading to a more recent stable version, such as `0.8.10` or above, include:

1. **Enhanced Security**: Newer versions of Solidity come with important security patches and fixes for vulnerabilities that may exist in older versions. For example, the `0.8.x` series introduced a range of improvements related to gas optimizations, overflow checks, and more robust error handling.

2. **Improved Gas Efficiency**: Later versions of Solidity contain optimizations that make contract execution more gas-efficient. This means lower transaction costs and reduced risk of running into gas limit issues, especially important for complex smart contracts like raffles or games that may have a large number of participants.

3. **Increased Support for Modern Features**: Newer versions of Solidity provide support for more modern programming features and better language features. This includes improvements in handling of errors, better introspection of contract state, and tools like `custom errors` to save gas.

4. **Compiler Warnings and Error Messages**: Recent Solidity versions often have more helpful and precise warnings and error messages that can aid developers in spotting potential bugs or incorrect patterns in their contracts. This improves the overall reliability of the contract during development.

5. **Long-Term Maintenance**: Relying on a stable, recent version of Solidity ensures that the contract will be compatible with future updates in the ecosystem, minimizing the risk of having to deal with sudden breaking changes in the future. It also ensures that the contract can be more easily maintained and upgraded, as newer versions of Solidity provide better backward compatibility with tooling.

By using a recent stable version, developers can ensure that their contract is not only more secure and efficient but also easier to maintain and scale as the Solidity language and Ethereum ecosystem continue to evolve. Using an outdated version like `0.7.6` introduces unnecessary risks and limits the contract’s potential.



**Proof of Concept:**  
The specific issue is found in the `PuppyRaffle.sol` contract at line 2, where the floating version `^0.7.6` is used:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.7.6;
```


**Recommended Mitigation:**  
To mitigate the risks of using an outdated Solidity version such as `^0.7.6`, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to a recent, stable version. Below are the steps and guidance on how to ensure the use of a suitable Solidity version:

1. **Upgrade to the Latest Stable Version:**  
   Always aim to use the latest stable release of Solidity. As of the latest updates, the `0.8.x` series is highly recommended due to its performance improvements, security patches, and gas optimizations. For example, `0.8.10` and higher are considered stable and feature-rich versions.

2. **Pin the Exact Version:**  
   Instead of using a floating version like `^0.7.6`, which allows any version from `0.7.6` to the next major release (`0.8.0`), it is best to use a pinned version, such as `pragma solidity 0.8.10;`. This prevents the contract from accidentally compiling with a future version that might contain breaking changes.  

3. **Verify Stability of Solidity Versions:**  
   To find the most stable and recommended versions of Solidity, you can refer to the official Solidity GitHub repository and the [Solidity Release Notes](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases). The release notes provide detailed information on the changes, optimizations, and fixes made in each version.

By following these recommendations, you can ensure that your contract remains secure, efficient, and maintainable while avoiding the risks associated with using outdated versions of Solidity.

### [I-3] Constructor in `PuppyRaffle::constructor` does not validate the zero address for `PuppyRaffle::feeAddress`

**Description:**  
The constructor of the `PuppyRaffle` contract accepts an address `_feeAddress` to specify where the fees will be sent. However, there is no validation to check if the provided `_feeAddress` is the zero address (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`). If the zero address is provided, it may cause issues in future transactions involving fee transfers. The contract fails to guard against this, which is a vulnerability.

**Impact:**  
If deployer sets the `PuppyRaffle::feeAddress` to the zero address, any attempts to transfer fees to that address will fail, leading to unexpected behavior in the contract. This could block fee payments or cause the contract to function improperly, affecting the owner and potentially resulting in financial loss.

**Proof of Concept:**  
If a user deploys the contract with the `PuppyRaffle::feeAddress` set to the zero address (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`), all attempts to transfer fees will go to the addres zero. Below is an example of a test case that can be added to a test suite to verify the issue.

```solidity

    function testWithdrawFeesToZeroAddress() public playersEntered {
        address feeAddress = address(0);
        puppyRaffle = new PuppyRaffle(entranceFee, feeAddress, duration);

        address[] memory players = new address[](4);
        players[0] = playerOne;
        players[1] = playerTwo;
        players[2] = playerThree;
        players[3] = playerFour;
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * 4}(players);

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + duration + 1);
        vm.roll(block.number + 1);

        uint256 expectedPrizeAmount = ((entranceFee * 4) * 20) / 100;

        puppyRaffle.selectWinner();
        puppyRaffle.withdrawFees();
        assertEq(address(feeAddress).balance, expectedPrizeAmount);
    }

```

**Recommended Mitigation:**

To mitigate this issue, consider the following recommendations:

**Validate `feeAddress` in the constructor:**
   Add a validation check in the constructor to ensure that the `feeAddress` is not set to the zero address. If the zero address is provided, revert the transaction.

   Example:
   ```solidity
   require(_feeAddress != address(0), "PuppyRaffle: Fee address cannot be the zero address");
   ```

### [I-4] Use of non-CEI pattern in `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` introduces potential reentrancy vulnerability

**Description:**  
The `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` function is vulnerable due to its use of a non-CEI (Checks-Effects-Interactions) pattern. Specifically, the function interacts with external addresses (via `winner.call{value: prizePool}("")`) not until the end.

**Impact:**  
The impact is very low since we just need to change the minting of nft before the transfer to ether.


**Recommended Mitigation:**

To mitigate the risk of reentrancy attacks, the following recommendations should be considered:

1. **Follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern:**  

   Updated `selectWinner` function following the CEI pattern:

```diff
   function selectWinner() external {
       require(block.timestamp >= raffleStartTime + raffleDuration, "PuppyRaffle: Raffle not over");
       require(players.length >= 4, "PuppyRaffle: Need at least 4 players");

       uint256 winnerIndex = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % players.length;
       address winner = players[winnerIndex];

       uint256 totalAmountCollected = players.length * entranceFee;
       uint256 prizePool = (totalAmountCollected * 80) / 100;
       uint256 fee = (totalAmountCollected * 20) / 100;
       totalFees = totalFees + uint64(fee);

       uint256 tokenId = totalSupply();
       uint256 rarity = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.difficulty))) % 100;
       if (rarity <= COMMON_RARITY) {
           tokenIdToRarity[tokenId] = COMMON_RARITY;
       } else if (rarity <= COMMON_RARITY + RARE_RARITY) {
           tokenIdToRarity[tokenId] = RARE_RARITY;
       } else {
           tokenIdToRarity[tokenId] = LEGENDARY_RARITY;
       }

       // State changes first
       delete players;
       raffleStartTime = block.timestamp;
       previousWinner = winner;

       // External call last
+       _safeMint(winner, tokenId);
       (bool success,) = winner.call{value: prizePool}("");
       require(success, "PuppyRaffle: Failed to send prize pool to winner");
-       _safeMint(winner, tokenId);
    }
```

### [I-5] Use of Magic Numbers in `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` function makes the contract less maintainable and introduces potential for errors.

**Description:**  
The `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` function contains several "magic numbers," which are hard-coded constant values directly embedded into the code. For instance, the percentage values (80% for the prize pool, 20% for the fee) are calculated using `80` and `20` respectively. Additionally, the rarity boundaries (e.g., `COMMON_RARITY`, `RARE_RARITY`, `LEGENDARY_RARITY`) are used without descriptive constants or documentation. These "magic numbers" can lead to confusion for future developers, making the code harder to maintain, test, and extend.

**Impact:**  
Hardcoding percentages and other numerical values directly in the code reduces readability and increases the risk of introducing errors in the future. If these numbers need to be updated, there is a higher chance of inconsistency or human error. Furthermore, the lack of descriptive constants or documentation means that the meaning of these numbers can easily be misunderstood or incorrectly modified. This could lead to unintended behavior or financial losses in the raffle process. It also makes the code less flexible if the contract needs to evolve or be reused in other contexts.

**Proof of Concept:**  
The `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` function uses several magic numbers in its calculations:

```solidity
uint256 prizePool = (totalAmountCollected * 80) / 100;  // 80% prize pool
uint256 fee = (totalAmountCollected * 20) / 100;        // 20% fee
```

This usage of hardcoded values (80 and 20) for prize distribution makes the code difficult to understand and prone to errors if modifications are needed in the future. A developer who is unaware of the exact purpose of these numbers could incorrectly modify the prize distribution logic, potentially resulting in an unfair raffle outcome.

**Recommended Mitigation:**  

1. **Replace Magic Numbers with Constants:**  
   To improve maintainability and readability, replace all magic numbers with descriptive constant variables. For example, the 80% prize pool and 20% fee can be stored as constants:

```solidity
   uint256 public constant PRIZE_POOL_PERCENTAGE = 80;
   uint256 public constant FEE_PERCENTAGE = 20;
   uint256 public constant POOL_PRECISION = 100;
```
