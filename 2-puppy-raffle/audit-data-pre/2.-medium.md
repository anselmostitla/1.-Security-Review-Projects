### [M-1] Overflow and Unsafe Cast Vulnerability in `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` When Updating `totalFees`

**Description:**  
The `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` function contains a critical vulnerability in the line where it updates `totalFees`:

```solidity
totalFees = totalFees + uint64(fee);
```

Here, the `fee` is a `uint256` value, but it is cast to `uint64` before being added to `totalFees`. This is an unsafe cast, as the value of `fee` may exceed the maximum value allowed for a `uint64`, which is `18,446,744,073,709,551,615`. If the `fee` exceeds this limit, it will overflow, causing incorrect calculations for `totalFees` and other related variables.

Additionally, if the contract collects a large amount of fees (e.g., 20 ETH worth of fees), the cast to `uint64` will lose precision and may lead to undesired behavior in the prize distribution and overall contract logic.

**Impact:**
The overflow and unsafe cast to `uint64` pose significant risks to the integrity of the raffle system. If the value of `fee` exceeds the `uint64` limit, it can cause an overflow, resulting in incorrect values for `totalFees` and other variables dependent on it. This vulnerability can allow attackers to manipulate the prize pool distribution, potentially stealing funds or causing the raffle to behave unpredictably.

In the worst case, this could result in the manipulation of the prize distribution, loss of funds, and unfair outcomes, thus undermining trust in the contract and its integrity.

**Proof of Concept:**  
The vulnerability manifests when the `fee` value exceeds the `uint64` range during the addition to `totalFees`. For instance, if the contract collects a large fee (e.g., 20 ETH worth of fees), this value may exceed the maximum value allowed for a `uint64` variable, causing the addition operation to result in an overflow. This results in an incorrect value for `totalFees` and impacts the subsequent prize distribution.

To demonstrate this, consider a scenario where the fee is large enough to cause an overflow:

1. The `fee` value is a `uint256` that exceeds `18,446,744,073,709,551,615`.
2. When the `fee` is cast to `uint64`, it wraps around to a smaller value due to the overflow.
3. The overflow causes `totalFees` to have an incorrect value, which affects subsequent calculations for the prize pool and prize distribution.

For example, if `fee = 20 ETH` (a large value) and `totalFees = 18,446,744,073,709,551,615` (maximum `uint64` value), the addition would overflow and cause `totalFees` to revert to a very small number or incorrect value.

**Recommended Mitigation:**  

1. **Use Larger Data Types for `totalFees` and `fee`:**  
   To mitigate the overflow and casting issue, both `totalFees` and `fee` should be stored as `uint256` rather than `uint64`. This ensures that large values for `fee` can be safely handled without causing an overflow. The updated code would be:

```solidity
   totalFees = totalFees + fee;
```
