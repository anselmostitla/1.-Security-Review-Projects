### [G-1] Gas Optimization: `PuppyRaffle::raffleDuration` Should Be Immutable

**Description:**  
In the `PuppyRaffle` contract, the variable `PuppyRaffle::raffleDuration` is defined as a mutable public state variable. This variable is intended to represent the duration of the raffle and should remain constant throughout the contract's lifecycle.

The `PuppyRaffle::raffleDuration` should be immutable, meaning its value should be assigned once during contract initialization and should never be changed afterward. This would optimize the contract by reducing gas consumption.

**Impact:**  
Allowing `PuppyRaffle::raffleDuration` to be mutable has several negative implications:
1. **Increased Gas Costs:** Storing a mutable value that doesn't need to change requires more gas than necessary. 

2. **Decreased Contract Efficiency:** Mutability in this context is redundant because the raffle duration is constant. It introduces unnecessary complexity and increases the gas cost for every transaction that interacts with this variable.

**Proof of Concept:**  
In the current contract, `PuppyRaffle::raffleDuration` is declared as a mutable public state variable. This is unnecessary since the raffle duration remains constant once set at deployment.

```solidity
uint256 public raffleDuration;
```

**Recommended Mitigation:**

To mitigate this issue, consider the following actions:

1. **Mark `PuppyRaffle::raffleDuration` as immutable:**  
   Declare `PuppyRaffle::raffleDuration` as immutable to ensure that it is only assigned during contract initialization and cannot be modified afterward. This approach will save gas by eliminating unnecessary write operations and will increase contract security by preventing unauthorized changes.

2. **Audit Other Variables:**  
   Review other state variables in the contract that may not need to change after initialization. If they can be marked as immutable, this will further optimize the contract and reduce gas usage.

3. **Follow Best Practices for Gas Optimization:**  
   By marking variables like `PuppyRaffle::raffleDuration` as immutable, you are adhering to best practices for gas optimization, making your contract more efficient and cost-effective in the long run.

By implementing these changes, you will optimize the `PuppyRaffle` contract, reduce unnecessary gas consumption, and make the raffle more secure and efficient.


### [G-2] Use of non-constant state variables for URIs in `PuppyRaffle` contract can lead to inefficient gas consumption

**Description:**  
In the `PuppyRaffle` contract, certain values, such as the URIs for images, are declared as non-constant state variables. Specifically, the variables `PuppyRaffle::commonImageUri`, `PuppyRaffle::rareImageUri`, and `PuppyRaffle::legendaryImageUri` are declared as `string` types, but they do not change during the contract's lifecycle.

**Impact:**  
Using non-constant variables for values that do not change during the contract's execution unnecessarily consumes gas. When these values are stored in contract storage, it requires additional operations, leading to higher transaction costs. In contrast, using `constant` variables would embed the values directly in the contract bytecode, significantly reducing gas usage for read operations. This results in inefficiency and increased costs for interacting with the contract.

**Proof of Concept:**  
Consider the following variables in the `PuppyRaffle` contract:

```solidity
string private commonImageUri = "ipfs://QmSsYRx3LpDAb1GZQm7zZ1AuHZjfbPkD6J7s9r41xu1mf8";

string private rareImageUri = "ipfs://QmUPjADFGEKmfohdTaNcWhp7VGk26h5jXDA7v3VtTnTLcW";

string private legendaryImageUri = "ipfs://QmYx6GsYAKnNzZ9A6NvEKV9nf1VaDzJrqDR23Y8YSkebLU";
```

**Recommended Mitigation:**
To optimize gas usage and improve contract efficiency, consider the following recommendations:

1. **Mark the image URIs as `constant`:**  
   Update the variables `PuppyRaffle::commonImageUri`, `PuppyRaffle::rareImageUri`, and `PuppyRaffle::legendaryImageUri` to `constant`. This will embed their values directly in the bytecode, reducing the need for storage operations and improving gas efficiency.

   Example:
   ```solidity
   string private constant commonImageUri = "ipfs://QmSsYRx3LpDAb1GZQm7zZ1AuHZjfbPkD6J7s9r41xu1mf8";

   string private constant rareImageUri = "ipfs://QmUPjADFGEKmfohdTaNcWhp7VGk26h5jXDA7v3VtTnTLcW";

   string private constant legendaryImageUri = "ipfs://QmYx6GsYAKnNzZ9A6NvEKV9nf1VaDzJrqDR23Y8YSkebLU";
   ```


### [G-3] Gas inefficiency due to accessing `PuppyRaffle::players.length` multiple times in a loop

**Description:**  
In the `PuppyRaffle::enterRaffle` function, the code accesses the `PuppyRaffle::players.length` storage variable multiple times inside a nested loop. Each access to a storage variable in Solidity is a costly operation in terms of gas. By accessing `PuppyRaffle::players.length` repeatedly within the loops, the contract unnecessarily increases the gas consumption, leading to inefficient execution.

**Impact:**  
The repeated access to `PuppyRaffle::players.length` in the loop increases the gas cost, especially when there are many players. This gas inefficiency may result in higher transaction costs and discourage users from interacting with the contract, particularly as the number of participants grows. It can also cause a denial of service (DoS) by pricing out users due to high gas costs, impacting the scalability of the raffle contract.

**Proof of Concept:**  
The issue can be demonstrated by observing how gas usage increases with the number of players. When the loop repeatedly accesses `PuppyRaffle::players.length` during each iteration, the gas usage scales inefficiently.

A potential test case to observe this could look like this:

```solidity
// PuppyRaffleTest.t.sol

function testGasInefficiency() public {
    // Assuming a pre-populated raffle with players
    uint256 initialGas = gasleft();
    PuppyRaffle raffle = new PuppyRaffle(1 ether, address(this), 30 days);
    
    // Add 1000 players to simulate the scenario
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        raffle.enterRaffle{value: 1 ether}();
    }
    
    uint256 finalGas = gasleft();
    uint256 gasUsed = initialGas - finalGas;
    console.log("Gas used by the raffle with 1000 players:", gasUsed);
}
```

The test would show a significant increase in gas usage when the number of players increases due to redundant accesses to `PuppyRaffle::players.length`


**Recommended Mitigation:**

To optimize gas usage and improve contract efficiency, consider the following recommendations:

**Store `PuppyRaffle::players.length` in a local variable:**  
   Accessing the length of an array repeatedly inside loops can be avoided by storing the value in a local variable before entering the loop. This eliminates redundant storage reads, improving gas efficiency.

   Example:
   ```solidity
   uint256 playerCount = players.length;
   for (uint256 i = 0; i < playerCount - 1; i++) {
       for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < playerCount; j++) {
           require(players[i] != players[j], "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
       }
   }
   ```
