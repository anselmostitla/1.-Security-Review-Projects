### [L-1] Incorrect behavior of `PuppyRaffle::getActivePlayerIndex` could mislead users about their raffle status

**Description:**  
The `PuppyRaffle::getActivePlayerIndex` function is intended to return the index of an active player in the raffle. However, the implementation contains a flaw in that if a player is the first in the `PuppyRaffle::players` array (at index 0), the function will return 0 as the index, even if they are inactive. Additionally, if a player is inactive and not present in the `PuppyRaffle::players` array, the function will also return 0, which could mislead the player into thinking they are active when they are not.

**Impact:**  
This behavior could lead to confusion and frustration for users. For instance, a player who is inactive but happens to be at index 0 might mistakenly believe they are active, while a player who is genuinely inactive might incorrectly assume they are still part of the raffle. This could potentially result in players acting on incorrect assumptions about their participation status and impact their decision-making. Furthermore, this misrepresentation could be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the raffle or deceive other participants.

**Proof of Concept:**  
The following example demonstrates how the `PuppyRaffle::getActivePlayerIndex` function could lead to confusion, especially for the first player in the `players` array.

```solidity
// Example test case to demonstrate the issue
function test_getActivePlayerIndex() public {
    address playerOne = makeAddr("playerOne");
    address playerTwo = makeAddr("playerTwo");
    
    // Add two players to the raffle
    puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee}(playerOne);
    puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee}(playerTwo);
    
    // Mark playerOne as inactive (or removed)
    puppyRaffle.removePlayer(playerOne);
    
    // Call getActivePlayerIndex for both players
    uint256 indexPlayerOne = puppyRaffle.getActivePlayerIndex(playerOne);
    uint256 indexPlayerTwo = puppyRaffle.getActivePlayerIndex(playerTwo);
    
    console.log("Player One Index: ", indexPlayerOne); // Expected: 0 (but should ideally be an error or revert)
    console.log("Player Two Index: ", indexPlayerTwo); // Expected: 1
}
```

This test case shows that even if `playerOne` is removed from the raffle, the function still returns 0 as the index, making the player believe they are still active. However, the playerTwo index is returned correctly.


**Recommended Mitigation:**

To resolve this issue, the following mitigations should be considered:

1. **Return a proper indication for inactive players:**  
   If the player is not active or removed, `PuppyRaffle::getActivePlayerIndex` should return a value that clearly indicates this, such as reverting the transaction or returning a special value (like `uint256(-1)` or another predefined value). This ensures that the player can distinguish between being an active participant and being inactive.

   Updated implementation for `getActivePlayerIndex`:
   ```solidity
   function getActivePlayerIndex(address player) external view returns (uint256) {
       for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
           if (players[i] == player) {
               // If the player is inactive, return a value indicating they are not active
               if (playerStatus[player] == false) {
                   return uint256(-1); // Or revert with a custom error
               }
               return i;
           }
       }
       // Return a clear indication that the player is not found or inactive
       return uint256(-1); // Or revert with a custom error
   }

2. **Ensure clear status checking:**

    Implement a function or status that can be used to confirm whether a player is active. This will provide clarity to both the contract and users.

    ```solidity
    mapping(address => bool) public playerStatus;

    function isPlayerActive(address player) public view returns (bool) {
        return playerStatus[player];
    }

    ```
