This format or layout is very important:

### [S-#] TITLE (Root Cause + Impact)

**Description:**

Explanatory text of the vulnerability related to the Description

**Impact:**

Explanatory text of the vulnerability related to the Impact

**Proof of Concept:**
Explanatory text of the vulnerability related to the proof of concept 

shell/javascript/solidity code if neccessary 

Some other text of the vulnerability related to the proof of concept 




**Recommended Mitigation**

Explanatory text of the vulnerability related to the recommended mitigation 

shell/javascript/solidity code if neccessary 

Some other text of the vulnerability related to the recommended mitigation 





This is the vulnerability I found in a smart contract (I myself marked with @audit, so this comment is not part of the protocol, it is for me as a reference where is an issue):

function deposit(...){
   .
   .
   .
         else {
            // This will be the "initial" funding of the protocol. We are starting from blank here!
            // We just have them send the tokens in, and we mint liquidity tokens based on the weth
            _addLiquidityMintAndTransfer(
                wethToDeposit,
                maximumPoolTokensToDeposit,
                wethToDeposit
            );
            // In the function above we make an external call
            // and the we update a local variable, it is probably fine because is not a state variable
            // q does not follows CEI pattern
            // @audit-info it would be better if this was before the _addLiquidityMintAndTransfer call so that protocol follow CEI
            liquidityTokensToMint = wethToDeposit;
        }
   .
   .
   .
}

I want you to write a short report as markdown file, that is I want you to create a title (do not include in the title this "(Root Cause + Impact)" it just a guide for you), a description, the impact (of the vulnerability) and the recommended mitigation (of the vulnerability).

For every variable or function name or element in the smart contract please preceed or prefix it with the name of the smart contract followed by "::" and then followed by the name of the variable, or the name of the function or the element we are dealing. Except when the smart contract element is in a shell/javascript/solidity piece of code, please do not precceed or prefix it with the name of the smart contract.

The name of the smart contract I am analysing is: TSwapPool

Please generate me a short markdown file
