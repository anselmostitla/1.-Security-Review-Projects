This format or layout is very important:

### [S-#] TITLE (Root Cause + Impact)

**Description:**

Explanatory text of the vulnerability related to the Description

**Impact:**

Explanatory text of the vulnerability related to the Impact

**Proof of Concept:**
Explanatory text of the vulnerability related to the proof of concept (section-1 of the proof of concept)

shell/javascript/solidity code if neccessary (section-2 of the proof of concept)

Some other text of the vulnerability related to the proof of concept (section-3 of the proof of concept)

(remember put everything of this parat as a markdown, include **Proof of Concept:**, section-1, section-2, section-3 as part of a markdown file, do not separate them, because you are putting apart)


**Recommended Mitigation**

Explanatory text of the vulnerability related to the recommended mitigation (section-A of the recommended mitigation)

shell/javascript/solidity code if neccessary (section-B of the recommended mitigation)

Some other text of the vulnerability related to the recommended mitigation (section-C of the recommended mitigation)

(remember put everything of this parat as a markdown, include **Proof of Concept:**, section-A, section-B, section-C as part of a markdown file, do not separate them, because you are separating them)



This is the vulnerability I found in a smart contract:

    constructor(address wethToken) {
        // @audit - info - lacking zero address check / lacks a zero-check on
        i_wethToken = wethToken;
    }

I want you to write a short report as markdown file, that is I want you to create a title (do not include in the title this "(Root Cause + Impact)" it just a guide for you), a description, the impact (of the vulnerability) and the recommended mitigation (of the vulnerability).

For every variable or function name or element in the smart contract please preceed or prefix it with the name of the smart contract followed by "::" and then followed by the name of the variable, or the name of the function or the element we are dealing. Except when the smart contract element is in a shell/javascript/solidity piece of code.

The name of the smart contract I am analysing is: PoolFactory

Please generate me a short markdown file

This format or layout is very important for two files i want you to create.

File1.md

### [S-#] TITLE (Root Cause + Impact)

**Description:**
please here include some bla bla of the vulnerability, if is neccessary include a shell/javascript/solidity code

**Impact:**
please here include some bla bla of the vulnerability, if is neccessary include a shell/javascript/solidity code

File2.md

### [S-#] TITLE (Root Cause + Impact)

**Proof of Concept**

Explanatory text of the vulnerability related to the proof of concept (section-1 of the proof of concept)

shell/javascript/solidity code if neccessary (section-2 of the proof of concept)

Some other text of the vulnerability related to the proof of concept (section-3 of the proof of concept)

(remember put everything of this parat as a markdown, include **Proof of Concept:**, section-1, section-2, section-3 as part of a markdown file, do not separate them, because you are putting apart)

**Recommended Mitigation**
Explanatory text of the vulnerability related to the recommended mitigation

shell/javascript/solidity code if neccessary

Some other text of the vulnerability related to the recommended mitigation

(remember everything as part of a markdown format)

This is the vulnerability I found in a smart contract:

    constructor(address wethToken) {
        // @audit - info - lacking zero address check / lacks a zero-check on
        i_wethToken = wethToken;
    }

I want you to write two short reports as markdown files, 


For every variable or function name or element in the smart contract please preceed it with the name of the smart contract followed by "::" and then followed by the name of the variable, or the name of the function or the element we are dealing.

Only when you generate solidity code, put the variable or element as it is, without precceeding it with the name of the smart contract

The name of the smart contract I am analysing is: PoolFactory
