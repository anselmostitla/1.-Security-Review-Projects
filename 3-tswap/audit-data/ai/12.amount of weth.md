This format or layout is very important:

### [S-#] TITLE (Root Cause + Impact)

**Description:**

Explanatory text of the vulnerability related to the Description

**Impact:**

Explanatory text of the vulnerability related to the Impact

**Proof of Concept:**
Explanatory text of the vulnerability related to the proof of concept (section-1 of the proof of concept)

shell/javascript/solidity code if neccessary (section-2 of the proof of concept)

Some other text of the vulnerability related to the proof of concept (section-3 of the proof of concept)

(remember put everything of this parat as a markdown, include **Proof of Concept:**, section-1, section-2, section-3 as part of a markdown file, do not separate them, because you are putting apart)


**Recommended Mitigation**

Explanatory text of the vulnerability related to the recommended mitigation (section-A of the recommended mitigation)

shell/javascript/solidity code if neccessary (section-B of the recommended mitigation)

Some other text of the vulnerability related to the recommended mitigation (section-C of the recommended mitigation)

(remember put everything of this parat as a markdown, include **Proof of Concept:**, section-A, section-B, section-C as part of a markdown file, do not separate them, because you are separating them)



This is the vulnerability I found in a smart contract (it is marked with @audit):

    /**
     * @notice wrapper function to facilitate users selling pool tokens in exchange of WETH
     * @param poolTokenAmount amount of pool tokens to sell
     * @return wethAmount amount of WETH received by caller
     */
    function sellPoolTokens(
        uint256 poolTokenAmount
    ) external returns (uint256 wethAmount) {
        // i_poolToken is input
        // @audit this is wrong, the third argument in swapExactOutput should be the amount of weth to go out from the protocol
        return
            swapExactOutput(
                i_poolToken,
                i_wethToken,
                poolTokenAmount,
                uint64(block.timestamp)
            );
    }

I want you to write a short report as markdown file, that is I want you to create a title (do not include in the title this "(Root Cause + Impact)" it just a guide for you), a description, the impact (of the vulnerability) and the recommended mitigation (of the vulnerability).

For every variable or function name or element in the smart contract please preceed or prefix it with the name of the smart contract followed by "::" and then followed by the name of the variable, or the name of the function or the element we are dealing. Except when the smart contract element is in a shell/javascript/solidity piece of code, please do not precceed or prefix it with the name of the smart contract.

The name of the smart contract I am analysing is: TSwapPool

Please generate me a short markdown file
